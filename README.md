# Unix-System-Monitor-project
The Unix System Monitor is a C++ application designed to monitor system resources on Unix-based systems in real-time. The application employs multi-threading to handle simultaneous data collection and analysis, providing users with comprehensive insights into system performance and resource utilization.

Steps of Unix System Monitor project in C++:

Step 1: Setting Up the Project
- Create a new directory for your project.
- Inside the directory, create the necessary source files (`main.cpp`, `monitor.cpp`, `monitor.h`).
- Optionally, set up a Makefile for compiling the project.

Step 2: Designing the Monitor Class
- Define the `Monitor` class in `monitor.h`.
- Declare member functions to execute Unix commands (`ps`, `pstack`, `pmap`, `vmstat`, `iostat`, `netstat`) and retrieve system information.
- Include necessary headers such as `<iostream>` and `<string>`.

Step 3: Implementing the Monitor Class
- Define the member functions of the `Monitor` class in `monitor.cpp`.
- Use C++ standard library functions like `system()` or `popen()` to execute Unix commands and capture their output.
- Parse the command output to extract relevant system information.
- Store the extracted information in appropriate data structures.

Step 4: Implementing Multi-threading
- Include the `<thread>` header in `monitor.h`.
- Declare a function for each command to be executed concurrently.
- Create threads in the `Monitor` class constructor to run these functions concurrently.
- Ensure proper synchronization and data sharing between threads using mutexes or other synchronization primitives.

Step 5: Designing the User Interface
- Decide on the type of user interface (CLI or GUI).
- If CLI, design a command-line interface with options for user interaction and displaying system metrics.
- If GUI, choose a graphical toolkit/library such as Qt or GTK and design the interface to visualize system metrics.

Step 6: Implementing the User Interface
- Write code in `main.cpp` to interact with the `Monitor` class and display system metrics.
- For CLI, use standard input/output functions (`std::cout`, `std::cin`) to display information and handle user input.
- For GUI, use the chosen graphical toolkit/library to create windows, buttons, and other UI components.

Step 7: Testing and Debugging
- Test the application on a Unix-based system (e.g., Linux) to ensure it functions correctly.
- Verify that system metrics are accurately captured and displayed.
- Debug any issues encountered during testing.

Step 8: Refining and Optimizing
- Refactor code for clarity, modularity, and efficiency.
- Optimize resource usage and performance where possible.
- Consider implementing additional features or enhancements based on user feedback or requirements.

Step 9: Documentation and Packaging
- Document the project including usage instructions, system requirements, and any dependencies.
- Package the project for distribution, if applicable, ensuring all necessary files and resources are included.

Step 10: Submission and Sharing
- Share your project on platforms like GitHub to showcase your skills and contribute to the developer community.
- Include the project on your resume/portfolio to demonstrate your proficiency in C++ programming, Unix systems, and multi-threading.

By following these steps, you'll be able to successfully implement the Unix System Monitor project and gain valuable experience in system monitoring, C++ programming, and multi-threading.
